Is the Unix pipe operator a type of Kleisli composition? We have structure (files),
operations which can map files to generate more files...? No, I don't think so.

But a broader questions is, how much of the unix-styled programming relates to
category theory. There seems to be a lot of overlap between haskell methodologies and
unix-philosophy -- has there ever been thought put into defining this relation? Seems
like it might be totally at-ends because current operating systems are filled with
effects.
