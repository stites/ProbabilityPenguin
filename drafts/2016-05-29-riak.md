================

Talking to sentenai, who uses riak.

Originally I thought riak got a lot of flack from [Kyle Kingsbury's][kyle] [Jepsen tool][gith], which simulates network partitions.[See post here][riak-post].

(for more on this, see [software engineering radio episode 241][ser])

However, after reading through the post - I realized this is only because the defaults don't use CRDTs out-of-the-box. More on CRDTs, see [se-radio 252][252].

Thoughts on riak: it's slimmed down dynamo. great with fault-tolerance once you get crdts working. [differences are here][compare].
