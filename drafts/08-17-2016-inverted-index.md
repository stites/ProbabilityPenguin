what?

> An inverted index (postings file, inverted file) is an index data structure
> storing a mapping from content, such as words or numbers, to its locations in
> a database file, or in a document or a set of documents (named in contrast to
> a Forward Index, which maps from documents to content). 

why?

> The purpose of an inverted index is to allow fast full text searches, at a
> cost of increased processing when a document is added to the database. The
> inverted file may be the database file itself, rather than its index. It is
> the most popular data structure used in document retrieval systems,[1] used on
> a large scale for example in search engines. Additionally, several significant
> general-purpose mainframe-based database management systems have used inverted
> list architectures, including ADABAS, DATACOM/DB, and Model 204.

how?

> There are two main variants of inverted indexes: A record-level inverted index
> (or inverted file index or just inverted file) contains a list of references
> to documents for each word. A word-level inverted index (or full inverted
> index or inverted list) additionally contains the positions of each word
> within a document.[2] The latter form offers more functionality (like phrase
> searches), but needs more processing power and space to be created.
