what is a database migration, fundamentally?

version control.

This is a solved problem in the software world -- but not in DBA-land. So what makes
version control non-trivial for data stores?

what is the current state?

has some script already been applied?

are we in a state were we can apply the script?

are there schizms between prod, develop, and test?

how do you provision a new database? - baselining, starting from the top of a
commit-list

will the software work agains the current database spec?
