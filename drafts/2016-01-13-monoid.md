A monoid is a function that takes two arguments and follows two the laws of
associativity and identity, that's it!

Keep in mind that we're talking about a _Monoid_ here! _Monoids_ are more
general and can be represented in typeclasses which address many types, while a
_Monad_ is a specific, unambiguous type which we give to our variables.

Here is a haskell `Monoid` typeclass:

    class Monoid m where
      mempty :: m                    -- id
      mappend::m->m->m               -- join two things together
      mconcat :: [m] -> m            -- add a thing to a bunch of other things (defined with the above)
