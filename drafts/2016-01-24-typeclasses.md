typeclasses are not OOP classes

typeclasses are not implicits -- what are implicits?

typeclasses do not generate vtables

you call a function and where do you get the function? It's not a vtable, so it will
go to the type definitions, and allow us to pattern match _on the type_. It's a logic
programming style of dispatch based on the type that allows us to build up our
dictionary of functions.

 + parametricity : http://bit.ly/1OQfPjL
 + the ability to raise the ___ free theorem : http://bit.ly/1OQfQ7f

what is hedge-union?
