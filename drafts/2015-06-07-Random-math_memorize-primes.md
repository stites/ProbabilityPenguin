There's a bit of a cycle for all primes under 100:
2, 3, 5, 7
11, 13, 17, 19
23, 29
31, 37
41, 43, 47
53, 59
61, 67
71, 73, 79
83, 89
97

+ starting with the teens, every third set has 3 primes.
+ starting with the twenties, every third set has two primes ending in 3 and 9
+ starting with the thirties, every third set has two primes ending in 1 and 7
+ only the last set of primes - with 97 - doesn't follow suit9e.
