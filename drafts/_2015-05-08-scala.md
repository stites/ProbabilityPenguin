Because Scala has such crazy flexibility with operators (allowing you to declare your own), it has in place a hierarchy of precedence. This is unlike Java since Java only allows a finite set of operators to exist.

First, an operator is determined to be either infix or postfix - infix operations are of a higher magnitude of precedence. Then precedence occurs in the following order, determined by the first character of the operator (list is from highest to lowest):

  + * / %
  + + -
  + :
  + < >
  + ! =
  + &
  + ^
  + |
  + all other characters
  + any assignment operator
