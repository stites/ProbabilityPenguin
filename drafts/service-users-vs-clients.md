When thinking about "clients," also think about service users. Essentially,
users that are services. Clients really break down into the following:
 - Clients that are humans
 - Clients that are uninvested humans - dispatched by human interactions
 - Clients that are services
 - Clients that are services dispatched on behalf of services
