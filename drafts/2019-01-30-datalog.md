title: "[Draft] Learning Datalog"
---

I'm writing a small little tool to upload and query papers that I read. Since I'm the only user, I get the ability to take as long as I want with this project and use whatever tools I find interesting.

Datalog, as subset of Prolog, has come up as a potentially useful tool to [autogenerate hasktorch static types](https://github.com/hasktorch/hasktorch/issues/139), is an [innovative way to query a datastore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Datomic), and prolog has roots in [traditional AI](https://www.worldcat.org/title/prolog-programming-for-artificial-intelligence/oclc/722841722), [computational linguistics](https://www.worldcat.org/title/natural-language-processing-for-prolog-programmers/oclc/27172159), and [some modern (and famous) AI programs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watson_\(computer\)#Software).

(I also ran into William Byrd (of "A Reasoned Schemer") who is researching the union of neural architectures and prolog -- something to look forward to!)

Logic programming is also a complete paradigm shift, so this might take a while to learn. Let's get started!

I'm starting off by working through "[Learn Datalog Today](http://www.learndatalogtoday.org)" which uses Datomic as a motivating use-case, so there will be a number of references to the latter. We'll also be using the haskell [datalog](https://github.com/travitch/datalog) package as a reference to clear up confusion.

## Datomic ground-rules

Datomic is centered around _datoms_ which are 4-tuples consisting of Entity IDs, Attributes, Values, and Transaction IDs. Here's the example:


```
[<e-id>  <attribute>      <value>          <tx-id>]
...
[ 167    :person/name     "James Cameron"    102  ]
[ 234    :movie/title     "Die Hard"         102  ]
[ 234    :movie/year      1987               102  ]
[ 235    :movie/title     "Terminator"       102  ]
[ 235    :movie/director  167                102  ]
...
```

When datoms share Entity IDs in this movie database, they reference the same entity (a movie in the case of `235`), and when the value is an entity id (in the case of the last datom), it is a pointer to another datom (here: James Cameron). We'll discuss Transaction IDs later.

## In Haskell's datalog

In haskell's datalog, we'd create a table like this with the following:
