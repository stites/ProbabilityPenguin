MA has to be recursive to handle world-scale black swans so that it will grow

Newton's first principal/law of logic: Everything that exists in the universe we can
discover through what we observe

Paradox: If we should choose to believe in god or not, we should believe in god since
it has no consequences to us in our lifetimes, yet has extrodinary benefit to us
after our lifetimes.

If we should choose to believe in god or not, we should choose not believe in god since the possiblility of believing in the wrong god could lead to eternal damnation (certain gods are mutually exclusive).
