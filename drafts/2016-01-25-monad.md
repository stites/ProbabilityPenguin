clas Applicative m => Monad m where
    (>>=)  :: m a -> (a -> m b) -> m b  -- "bind" aka "special sauce" aka "plunger"
    (>>)   :: m a -> m b -> m b         -- "seq" or "Mr. Pointy"
    return ::   a -> m a                -- is just pure

Applicative supers Monad (not nessecary, i believe). So we get:

Functor -> Applicative -> Monad

This is a law? At least in ghc circa 7.10 -- I think it's possible to have monads
that are not applicatives in the maths.

Notice:
Applicatives more powerful than Functors -- you can write fmap with Applicative:
    pure f <*> xs == fmap f xs

Monads are more powerful than Functors -- you can write fmap with Monad:
    fmap f xs = xs >>= return . f

Now we have:
    fmap :: Functor f     =>   (a -> b) -> f a        -> f b
    <*>  :: Applicative f => f (a -> b) -> f a        -> f b
    >>=  :: Monad f       => f a        -> (a -> f b) -> f b

we could get the same "effect" of bind with fmap:

    ghci> fmap (\x -> [x, 1]) [4,5,6]
    [[4,1],[5,1],[6,1]]

Monad allows us to generate additional monadic structure in the return type which can
be discarded. In essence, it's just like:

    ghci> :t concat
    concat :: Foldable t -> t [a] -> [a]
    concat ::               [[a]] -> [a]

Monad, in a sense is a generalization of concat.

The unique part of monad is `join` (cause bind and return are reproducable, seq for
different reasons later).

    join:: Monad m => m (m a) -> m a

Allows us to inject more structure!!! I mean we can do it in other forms, but the
discarding of layers is what makes this special.

Also, join plus (fmap?) is bind.

bind' :: Monad m => (a -> m b) -> m a -> m b
bind' f (m a) = (f a)
