I'm trying to weigh in on our options in building a complex modal. The two options that come to mind are to either write the modal as some kind of alternate state, or to write it as a directive. Here are some pros and cons that I can come up with for each option:

Option                     | Pros                   | Cons                     |
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
using ui.router for state  |
writing a complex directive|
