Structural diagrams
===================
Shows the static structure of the system and its parts on different abstraction
and implementation levels. Also includes how everything relates to eachother.
These can be everything from abstractions to concrete implementation details.

### Types of Structural Diagrams and my initial thoughts
  + Class diagrams: totally useless, code changes and intent should not be captured
    at this level or it migth constrain development. This should be auto-generated.

  + Object diagrams: totally useless, same as above. The abstraction of this might be
    interesting because "instance-level" starts to get into why instances exist.
    Ultimately, I am thinking this will be handled elsewhere.

  + Package diagram: This could be gold, but it might be _too_ abstract. Probably
    great for reasoning about dependencies.

  + Model diagram: This is going to be where most of the money is for fast-paced
    iteration. It seems a little too flexible, but a good way of reasoning about
    microservices

  + Composite Structure diagram:
