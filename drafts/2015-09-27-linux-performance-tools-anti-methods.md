Street light anti-method
"A drunk searching for keys"
"did you lose them under the street light"
"no, but that is where the light is best"

you only use the tools you know, on repeat, till insanity. (behavioural, use only intrinsic knowledge).

Drunk man anti-method
only use what you don't know, on repeat, for forever. (experimental, keep flipping switches until it works well enough).

Blame someone else anti-method
find osmething you aren't responsible for, blame that team and shift responsibility.

In summation: come up with a methodology instead
