associate property is not as strong as commutative property. Given:

    a + b + c + d + e + f

Associativity means we can get out that:

    ((a + b) + ((c + d) + (e + f)))

Is the same as the above, but commutative means that we can reorder them so that:

    f + e + d + a + b + c

is the same as the first. Addition and multiplication are commutative --
concatenation for list types are not.
