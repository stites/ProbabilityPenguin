my skeleton looks like the following:

I will probably take it down in a week or so since it's actually a pretty intimate thing for -- this is basically my life at this point.

The high-level things you should know are that _getting_ to this document was a lot of time as well, it helps that Scott and Cal strictly tell us not to work on projects, as it gave me more time to reflect. There were three other project proposals with pros/cons, milestones and milestone-estimates. Once this one was selected, I filled out the first milestone with higher detail and the next two with a "long-view" - the third milestone is barely planned out.

The real document is actually a couple of generations removed. This project is a collaboration, so I've recieved feedback and gotten a higher resolution on the first milestone. At work I try never to let a ticket take more than 4 hours. I also actively maintain greying out and strikethrough-ing any items I complete. Italics imply low piority. Things are roughly linear in order. Time are a shout-out to jira's 5-day weeks and 8-hour days -- I toyed with 7-day weeks and 3/4 hour days, but I work in jira so it's easier for me to stick to a single yardstick. As the milestone resolution decreases, you'll notice there are more "check-in and revise document" items.

Finally, this is only a planning doc. I also upload everything into trello where things are planned out in a kanban board with lists: Today,Done,Later and M-F,S,S + backlog. This is a variant taken from John Sonmez's kanban workflow. Some weeks I'm really good at all of this, other weeks I'm not so great. I usually plan everything out on Sundays, but with Top-Performer I realise that I value Sundays quite a bit for deep work and I'm trying to move planning to Monday mornings in office sync meetings (it's a lot harder, though).

Hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions!
