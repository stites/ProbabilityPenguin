title: "About Me"
---

Thanks for taking a personal interest in me. To reiterate for clarity, in case you've
wound up on the wrong page, my name is Sam Stites - I'm an engineer interested in
functional programming, category theory, and building applications.  My background is
in Data Science and I spend my spare time thinking about data infrastructure and how
the web works. In the past I've learned and taught fullstack javascript at Hack
Reactor, crunched data with the scipy stack at [TurboSquid][squid].

I owe a lot to [Venture for America][vfa] for getting me started in tech and the
startup scene, I'm a big believer in their mission.

In my spare time I love going to see improv comedy. I am a huge fan of The New
Movement Theater down in New Orleans. They're some of the funniest kids on the block
and I had the pleasure of learning improv from them for a year. You can also find me
in a park juggling 5..6..7(!) balls while on a slackline, while unicycling, while my
hat is on fire. I am a religous attendee of The Barefoot Monkey's, my old troupe,
<i>Monkey See Monkey Do</i> convention. It really is one of the most beautiful slices
of life.
