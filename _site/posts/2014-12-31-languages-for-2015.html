</p>
<p>Inspired by Richard Astbury’s post, entitled <a href="https://richorama.github.io/blog/2014/12/31/languages"><em>Langages</em></a>, I’ve come up with my own take on the state of languages for 2015 with respect to what I’d like to work on this year. As with Astbury, I’ll add a disclaimer that this post is “opinionated, poorly researched, and really just the thoughts in my head.” Going to start with the same list. Cheers!</p>
<h3 id="c">C#</h3>
<p>No intention of going in this direction. I hear that it’s actually not that bad, but at this point I think it’s too tightly coupled with Microsoft and I have an allergy. To be fair, though, I do hear that Microsoft is doing cool things - of late.</p>
<p><code>no</code></p>
<h3 id="f">F#</h3>
<p>Functional is way cooler, but I don’t want to associate myself with the oil and gas industry.</p>
<p><code>no</code></p>
<h3 id="javascriptiojs">Javascript/iojs</h3>
<p>What I know and breathe. I should probably contribute more to open source and stuff, but I really miss using a language with rich data constructs. I’m going on tour for 2015 and I get enough javascript in the office that I don’t think I have the option of missing out on this. I’ll have to check out iojs when I finish my tour.</p>
<p><code>not in 2015</code></p>
<h3 id="julia">Julia</h3>
<p>I like it so far. I’m afraid of missing features and it becoming too ruby-like. I think I’m going for more structure up-front to start with. Going to revisit the idea of building projects for this, but… perhaps next year.</p>
<p><code>not in 2015</code></p>
<h3 id="java">Java</h3>
<p>So Greg, our DSL-designer and PhD in languages, has convinced me that Java is not as terrible as I believe it to be and that mostly the problem lies in the fact that wide-spread use allows for a lot of shit programmers get their hands on it. I am looking forward to being proven wrong, but I’ll keep this only as required in the office… and perhaps build another Android app on the side to brush-up (Austin says that Davlik is a steaming pile of shit, though).</p>
<p><code>a small project and work in 2015</code></p>
<h3 id="clojure">Clojure</h3>
<p>Sounds pretty grand for large-scale data projects, it’s something we use in the office and by cousin swears by it for her job at Amazon - she’s a former computational statistician and a resident data scientist at Amazon. Perhaps, but not really too invested since I’ve got some scala under my belt already and I want to continue down that road.</p>
<p><code>not in 2015?</code></p>
<h3 id="scala">Scala</h3>
<p>Already started on this, looks pretty sweet, I like that a number of projects have been built in this. I’d like to do a project here with Akka.</p>
<p><code>yes - month-long projects</code></p>
<h3 id="ruby">Ruby</h3>
<p>A hot mess of features with too little structure, too little performance, and too little use outside of web servers. Sorry, but I’ve never been a fan.</p>
<p><code>never</code></p>
<h3 id="common-lisp">Common Lisp</h3>
<p>So interesting! I mean it’s definitely worth doing if you are going to start with emacs, which I have just kicked up. I like the idea… but perhaps not this year.</p>
<p><code>till next time</code></p>
<h3 id="go">Go</h3>
<p>Go surprised me, I have no idea what happened, but all of a sudden it’s big. Too soon to know if it’s worth the time. Not in 2015 for me.</p>
<p><code>not in 2015</code></p>
<h3 id="python">Python</h3>
<p>Python has shot itself in the foot with the 2.7/3.3 split. It’s pretty much fucked I think and will lose a lot of audience to - hopefully - julia. It’s so easy though… not really work learning since python is like reading a breezy book and I need something more to grow.</p>
<p><code>no</code></p>
<h3 id="haskell">Haskell</h3>
<p>In progress. just starting off by doing all project euler problems in this - then all my data analysis and ML projects.</p>
<p><code>yes</code></p>
<h3 id="erlang">Erlang</h3>
<p>Haskell seems too similar regarding end-goals. Perhaps if I hit another hardcore-functional kick.</p>
<p><code>not in 2015</code></p>
<h3 id="elm">Elm</h3>
<p>Only if the office allows. Other than that… too much work.</p>
<p><code>not really...</code></p>
<h3 id="php">PHP</h3>
<p>So… apparently a lot of good things exist now that rectify PHP. I will still judge you if you want to use this language.</p>
<p><code>no</code></p>
<h3 id="c-1">C</h3>
<p>Too much work, too little output. nope.</p>
<p><code>no</code></p>
<h3 id="c-2">C++</h3>
<p>Perhaps. That’s a big mountain to climb for a side project, the allure of having all the options you’d ever need with all the speed in the world. Perhaps.</p>
<p><code>perhaps</code></p>
<h3 id="rust">Rust</h3>
<p>There’s a huge fascination in the community. I have too much on my plate at the moment. If i start looking into one of the ’maybe’s above, I’ll go over this in more detail.</p>
<p><code>reevaluate later</code></p>
<h3 id="nim">Nim</h3>
<p>Same as rust.</p>
<h3 id="d">D</h3>
<p>Same as Rust and Nim.</p>
<h3 id="rackett">Rackett</h3>
<p>Did some work in Rackett in 2014. Fun stuff but not for this year.</p>
<h3 id="sml">SML</h3>
<p>Worked though A programming class in SML. Again, fun! but as a one-time deal.</p>
<h3 id="smalltalk">Smalltalk</h3>
<p>I’d love to research this as a case-study of the ‘what happened to this language’ line of thought. If I had the time!</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Continuing my experiments in Haskell, going to move on to Scala for the webserver support, then consider moving into C++, Nim, Rust or Julia. Work will still be Javascript and Java this year.</p>
