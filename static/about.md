title: "About Me"
---

Sam is a machine learning engineer at Sentenai, where he has researches
and implements reinforcement learning algorithms in a Haskell production
system to automate schema detection on nonstationary, heterogeneous time
streams. Most recently he has been working on Hasktorch, the Haskell
bindings to PyTorch's backend. When he is not neck-deep in FFI-land, he
fiddles around with neural-based NLP models and keeps chipping away at
textbooks in Category Theory.
