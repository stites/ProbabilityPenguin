- a post of Feynman's "What I cannot create, I do not understand" and how it relates to Software Engineering today. ps, [check out this quora link on some people's answers](https://www.quora.com/What-did-Richard-Feynman-mean-when-he-said-What-I-cannot-create-I-do-not-understand)

Type Theory:

Haskell notes:
- getting neco-ghc to use stack
- type erasure of the JVM in depth and how the lambda calculus / GHC makes this a trivial problem

Databases:
- "time is a philosophical construct when it comes to software"

OS:
