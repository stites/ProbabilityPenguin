- Check out research done at Network Science Institute, Northeastern:

- Shower thought: would an obscure research area (like PPL/Bayesian stats... or just one's h-index) be more widely recieved if it was just cited more (ie: pushing more application drives more cross-domain citations) -- or is there a requirement that it be in a particular field?
  - Shower answer: this is an explore-exploit trade off and the answer will always be contextual.
  - Second shower thought: unless you are talking about an h-index, success is also ill-defined.

Dentistry thought.
  - ML for Radiology is currently very active, but has an adoption
  problem. It seems to me that a good starting step could be in the
  private practice of dentistry since they are actively taking X-rays
  and don't have a radiology department (I assume). Plus, there are a
  lot more visual and external factors involved with teeth -- photos of
  gums, potentially reconstructing molds from images, and having insight
  into nerve endings from X-rays might capture a lot of the picture for
  a CV problem. Cross-listing this with a Dentist's reports could help
  find causes or solutions to problems with teeth. Teeth are also used
  in identifying victims of deaths (or is that just what the movies
  want us to believe?) so this information already has a curb-cut
  effect going on, perhaps that means that this industry would be more
  receptive to outsiders using their data (Q: how would the police
  identify me by dental records? All of my dentists seem completely
  independent of eachother -- do they use a central radiologist lab?)
  I mention this because I am missing extra teeth from each row (my
  teeth were too big as an adult) and I have had pretty simple tooth
  care with very low maintenance -- my dentists actually stopped telling
  me to floss, of late, and when I do I rarely find any plaquee.
  However, I know people who have horrible histories with their teeth
  and are told that the problem is genetic. A passing thought wonders
  if having less teeth gives more space for plaque to pass through --
  something I imagine that would only be solvable through an analysis on
  X-ray and dentist results. I hope someone picks this up!


Timeseries analysis:
- go over all ways to do cross validation and data augmentation
 + probably two posts. Also see this: www.fast.ai/2017/11/13/validation-sets/


Meta:
- a post of Feynman's "What I cannot create, I do not understand" and how it relates to Software Engineering today. ps, [check out this quora link on some people's answers](https://www.quora.com/What-did-Richard-Feynman-mean-when-he-said-What-I-cannot-create-I-do-not-understand)

Type Theory:
- logical entailment (I wrote a mysterious "`<>`", so maybe it has to do with monoid?)

APIs:
- versioning your api (both REST, CLI, and Lib).

Haskell notes:
- getting neco-ghc to use stack
- type erasure of the JVM in depth and how the lambda calculus / GHC makes this a trivial problem

Databases:
- "time is a philosophical construct when it comes to software"

OS:
- a "lesson of the day" series

SQL stuff:
- ["What is the difference between union and union all"](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/49925/what-is-the-difference-between-union-and-union-all)
- ["What is advanced SQL"](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2054130/what-is-advanced-sql)
