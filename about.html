  <h1>About Me</h1>

  <p>
  Greetings reader!
  </p>
  Thanks for taking a personal interest in me. To reiterate for clarity, in case you've wound up on the wrong page, my name is Sam Stites - I'm a fullstack engineer using Angular.js and an large interest in Node.js technologies. My background is in Data Science and I spend my spare time thinking about data infrastructure and how the web works. I love everything Javascript, which is something you get from spending something like 100 hours a week at <a href="//www.hackreactor.com">Hack Reactor</a>, as well as all things python - hailing from my work at <a href="//www.turbosquid.com">TurboSquid</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
  The startup scene is one of my favorite environments. I owe a lot to <a href="//www.ventureforamerica.org">Venture for America</a> for setting me on that track, and I am a strong believer their mission.
  </p>

  In my spare time I love going to see improv comedy. I am a huge fan of The New Movement Theater down in New Orleans. They're some of the funniest kids on the block and I had the pleasure of learning improv from them for a year. You can also find me in a park juggling 5..6..7(!) balls while on a slackline, while unicycling, while my hat is on fire. I am a religous attendee of The Barefoot Monkey's, my old troupe, <i>Monkey See Monkey Do</i> convention. It really is one of the most beautiful slices of life.
