This is a [pretty long article](http://eisenbergeffect.bluespire.com/all-about-angular-2-0/) written by a former member of the Angular2.0 team. The counter at the bottom estimates an hour-long read, so I figure'd I'd write some (as objective as possible) sparknotes:

##### Motivations for Angular 2.0

> When AngularJS was first created, almost
> five years ago, it was not originally
> intended for developers.

+ The web is no longer a jQuery cesspool
+ 5 years ago (angular's creation) mobile was barely a thing
+ [Learning angular looks like this](http://www.bennadel.com/resources/uploads/2013/feelings_about_angularjs_over_time.png)

##### Features and Design of Angular 2.0

+ it uses AtScript (note that you don't have to write AtScript to use it)
+ AtScript does some typechecking
+ They're trying to unify AngularJS and AngularDart â€” which is still a
  hit-or-miss
+ Dependency Injection will be better
+ Not everything has to be a singleton
+ Child Injectors (new feature) will add inheritance to services
+ Dynamic Loading will really be asynchronous this time.
+ Directives will not use a "kitchen-sink" approach:

> In Angular 2.0 there are three types
> of directives.
>
> + _Component Directive_ - Creates a custom component composed of
>   a View and a Controller. You can use it as a custom HTML element.
>   Also, the router can map routes to Components.
> + _Decorator Directive_ - Decorates an existing HTML element with 
>   additional behavior. A classic example is ng-show.
> + _Template Directive_ - Transforms HTML into a reusable template.
>    The directive author can control when and how the template is
>    instantiated and inserted into the DOM. Examples include ng-if
>    and ng-repeat.

+ Controllers will be less of a dumping ground:

> You may have heard that Controllers are dead in Angular 2.0.
> Well, that's not exactly true. In reality, Controllers are
> one part of what we are calling a Component. The Component has
> a View and a Controller.

+ "Components" are just classes, so with the new dependency injection,
  this makes controllers look a lot cleaner with the inheritance
  from Child Injectors.

+ Templating will have more syntax and, thus, will be given more 
  responsibility.

__Pros:__
> There's some pretty nice things going on in there to keep a small memory
> footprint, reduce garbage and enable super fast template instantiation.

__Cons:__
Directives are different and "the annotations are a bit verbose." 
Also, they break the [Separated Presentation principle](https://en.wikipedia.
org/wiki/Separation_of_presentation_and_content).

Example:

    @ComponentDirective({
        selector:'tab-container',
        directives:[NgRepeat]
    })
    export class TabContainer {  
        constructor(panes:Query<Pane>) {
            this.panes = panes;
        }

        select(selectedPane:Pane) { ... }
    }

> the primary benefits that is usually gained by using MVC, MVVM or any
> separated presentation pattern. Lest you think this is just theoretical, let

>
> + It is no longer possible to implement ng-include. The compiler requires a
>   ComponentDirective in order to compile HTML. Therefor you cannot compile
>   HTML on its own and include it into a View.

>   different view for phone than for desktop. You need to aggregate all the 
>   directives, filters, etc. that you use across all of your views and make
>   sure they are all represented in the single component's metadata. This is
>   a maintenance nightmare. You can no longer reliably remove anything from
>   the dependency list without checking all views. It's also easier to forget
>   adding  something.
>
> + It's not possible to have multiple runtime views for the same component.
>   Imagine that you are configuring your router with a set of routes. Several
>   of the routes can use the same "controller" but you need different views.
>   You can't really do that. Sorry.
>
> + It's completely impossible to enable ad hoc composition of screens. This
>   makes data-driven UI construction more complicated in the least. You can't
>   just render varying combinations of views and controllers (view models).
>   This limits reusability by discouraging compositional approaches to UI.
>   It forces you to subclass controllers in order to get different views.

> Fortunately, the design is still undergoing lots of changes.

The author has opinions on stuff and has voiced his opinion.

Templating Synax is still up in the air. This is the reason it was introduced, 
but there are technical problems and the community hates it. If you have 
recommendations, go to [the related issue][ngIssue].

The author has more opinions, which he states.

##### The most interesting part: two-way data binding might be canned!

> I don't know if you noticed it, but there isn't a single example of

##### The Router
+ Does what a router should do:
> + Simple JSON-based Route Config
> + Optional Convention over Configuration
> + Static, Parameterized and Splat Route Patterns
> + Query String Support
> + Use Push State or Hashchange
> + Navigation Model (For Generating a Navigation UI)
> + Document Title Updates
> + 404 Route Handling
> + History Manipulation

##### Child Routers
they exist.

##### Screen Activation (part of the routers)
you now have access to the following:
> + `canActivate` - Allow/Prevent navigating to the new controller.
> + `activate` - Respond to successful navigation to the new controller.
> + `canDeactivate` - Allow/Prevent navigation away from the old controller.
> + `deactivate` - Respond to successful navigation away from the old
>   controller.

...and the router is also going to Angular 1.3
