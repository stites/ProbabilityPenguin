Fun Fact
========

Apparently, the mixin pattern comes from the ice cream speak. A 'mixin' is when
you add extra ingredients to knead into your scoop of ice cream. Much like Cold
Stones, but the word 'mixin' actually comes from Steve's Ice Cream. A favorite of
MIT students in the late '70s.

In the history of code Mixins come from Flavors, an early object system for lisp. To read more, see the mixin page at [Cunningham & Cunningham, Inc](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?MixIn).
