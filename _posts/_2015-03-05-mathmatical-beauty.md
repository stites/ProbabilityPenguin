Euler's Formula is already pretty amazing — a link between exponential growth, the complex numbers, and sine and cosine:

And when we set phi to _pi_, a half-turn around a circle, we get Euler's identity — an example of mathmatical beauty.

It adds in 0 and 1, two more cool fundamental constants, to get show us a relationship between 0, 1, _pi_, _e_, and _i_ with three basic arithmetic operations. Each of those relationships happen exactly once. On top of that two of these numbers are transcendental, _pi_ and _e_!
