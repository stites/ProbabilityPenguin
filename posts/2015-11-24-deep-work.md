title: Deep Work, Better Engineering, and Machine Learning Research

I'm a big fan of [Cal Newport's work][cal] and, recently, have laid out a
three-month plan to immerse myself more deeply in becoming a better engineer
through functional programming, and to experimenting in the pursuit of machine
learning research as my specialized expertise.

This really isn't anything new. This three-month plan was a comprehensive
breakdown and milestone planning of CSSR, which I [introduced in a previous
post][cssr]. Primarily, I was able to scope out some pragmatic deadlines and
reach some good conclusions: including that publication comes before everything
else and that I will write CSSR in scala first to offset the added cost of
learning the extremely pure functional programming paradigm, then keep an
experimental feature branch running of the same work in Haskell - even though it
might blow the scope of this project out of proportion.

Quite frankly, this makes me nervous: I will have to account for the unknowns of
work, make ICML and KDD call-for-paper deadlines, and do it all in two languages
(which may be narrowed in scope down to one language). I'm intending to make a
number of social and personal sacrifices to make these deadlines, all
self-imposed.

Today has been the big scrub of Shallow Work -- tomorrow "Deep Work" begins in
the morning, and I will post updates of my progress every week in the form of
blog posts on CSSR, Scala, or Haskell.
