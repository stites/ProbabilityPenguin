title: 'Structured Deep Learning (alt: Embeddings are not just for words)'

Going through more of fastai -- Jeremy Howard points out that there is a huge gap between industry and academia where academia loves solving unsupervised learning problems and industry loves supervised ones (guess I'm lucky, working in semi-supervised learning). This is pretty easy to see since unsupervised learning is the task of understanding what you do not know, whereas supervised learning is just memorization. This point can be seen through [Andrew Ng and Geoffery Hinton's
interview on the deeplearning.ai channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eyhCTvrEtE).
