title: Autocomplete your git and thoughts on bash plugin managers
---

Just found a nifty little way to set up autocompletion in git. [Check out this Code
Worrier post][auto].

As a result, I've also come across just a few [bash][0] [plugin][1] [managers][2] and
gave them all whirl. They're all awefully slick but I think when it comes to bash,
much like in the C/C++ communities, you wind up with a top-heavy apple-core
population; the community is either very new and build out package managers like
these, or they are very weathered/experienced and no longer feel the need for this
kind of tool.

As for me, I'll be introducing bash-completion and sticking to _expand alias_
(<kbd>Esc</kbd>, <kbd>Ctrl-e</kbd>).
