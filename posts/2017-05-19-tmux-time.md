title: Tmux time - a one-liner and future thoughts for this site

---

Cool beans! `<Prefix>-t` displays the time in tmux!

Since moving to xmonad on FreeBSD, little things have become a lot
harder and, much in the same way with haskell, I have that feeling of,
"before I felt like an expert and everything broke, now I feel like a
beginner and everything works perfectly." My time has also been diverted
to towards the huge project of researching Machine Intelligence and
implementing a full system here at Sentenai, but I think it's important
to write about the little, possibly silly, technical things as well to
keep progress moving. So expect a few more silly posts like this one,
which will hopefully lower the barrier to future introspections.
