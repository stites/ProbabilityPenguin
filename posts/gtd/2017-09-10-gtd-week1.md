title: GTD\: Round 2, Week 1
---

Starting to document some workflow and do some review around my latest attempt at GTD with remember the milk. This might sound silly writing it out -- hopefully no one ever reads this.

Okay things that are working so far:
- all current "workflows" are encompassed (reading things in pocket, queuing up project wishlists, managing action items in multiple projects). Plus it's not super painful.
- I'm able to replicate "habits" just like in the Fabulous app (although I don't have some kind of guide to tell me about cute little embellishments), also it's way less ostentatious than Fabulous.
- It feels just like taskwarrior except the mobile app actually works -- which is surprisingly effective at getting me to remember things (but it's only week 1, so we'll see).
- I'm getting okay at putting things into RTM - it makes things quite easy. GTD is also useful because I don't need to look at things I put in until later.

Things want to work on next week:
- following my plan for the week. I think I constrain my tasks too much. I need to block them out better.
- remembering to do the weekly review. because I think it's important.
