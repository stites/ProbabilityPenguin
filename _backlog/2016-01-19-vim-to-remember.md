It's easy to get stuck doing only what you already know in vim, so here are some from vimgolf that I've found pretty nifty:
 - `.` repeat the insert-mode command from normal-mode
 - `<C-@>` is a null character, apparently - but it also seems to repeat the last added character. Like `.` when in insert-mode.
 - One that I just found - ctags lets you use: `<C-]>` to _jump to definitions across a project_ (whatttt!!!)

Okay, I'm finding a lot of ctags keybindings:
 - `<C-t>` go to cursor location before the last tag jump
