professor one:
translations between ovjects to vetors -> this is all molecule-based. so we're
talkign aboutnbiology?

NLP.

how to convert words into vectors.

map words to cetors -> that  then moves to sentences with vetors -> 

he's talkign about neural netowkrs



how do you get trust with preditive models?
prediction is not enoug

"misssion critical settings"
oideally, we want the method to give youREASONS why you should trust it...

... so somethgin like transparent algorithms???

okay, ML algorithms with Rationale

for the generator: encoder models, autoencoders

  sufficiency, sparsity, coherence

  minimize expected cost. the usual.
 
 polizy functions!

establishign trust / verification between systems and humans

LIME- group in UW.

Questions:
 - need a recap on _context_ — he kind of flew by that. It looks like he might
   be looking at inter-sentence relationships for the NLP example. What happens
   if there is some kind of contextual factor that breaks this model later?

Regina Parzilay:
- NPL usually. talking about cancer today.

npl neural networks rule, duh. requires highly annotated data.

-> trying to move to semi-supervised systems

-> trying to move rules-based systems into more intelligent ones

uncertainty, robustness

MCMC for this same type of thing

-> too slow

mean-field variational bayes

- fast

streamed data!!!

... but it might underestimate uncertainties, f

linear response variational bayes (takes "pertubation ideas from statistical
physics")


iMCMC takees a long time!

ii

quantify uncertainty

robustness:
- start with the prior... meerp. business as usual bayes
- USE HYPERPARAMETERS! if you run two models under the same hyperparameters, you
  can compare and check the "robustness" of a gold standard.
