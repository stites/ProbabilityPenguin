friends at VFA do a lot of bizdev stuff. Heard about a lot about certian mudane, stick-in-the-mud website work.

well, you should learn phantomJS. literally only two things to learn, maybe only one (jQuery), and BOOM you can now navigate a website with some "sentences." after that, just memorize a couple of patterns, how to start a phantomJS job, and you're done!

Plus, jQuery is enough to give you an edge in the startup world as a non-coder because you'll understand enough about how your website works to talk a little shop. Please don't be an asshole, in the words of Gary Chou, and think you know everything about code though.

If that floats your boat. you can automate a step further with cronjobs. Ever need to automate something and schedule it to happen at a later date? phantomJS that shit and run a cron task. Ever need to make it recurring? run a cron job? ever need to do three things at once, and make an appointment with your dentist? cron, biatches. minus the dentist stuff. I can't garuntee that one.
