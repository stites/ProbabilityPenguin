why jwts are a no-brainer:

self signed, so no storage involved. Even user information is not a problem since you
would need the server's private key(?).

why jwts are a pain in the butt:

Using them to store user information. When a user updates their account information,
the jwt would need to be updated as well. This isn't a huge hassle with something like
Session-based -- you could update the security context or something else while keeping
the user online -- but if you're using jwts, you'd have to invalidate that token and
all information is stored on there so everything gets fucked!
